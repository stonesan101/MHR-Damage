Monster Hunter Rise Damage Calculations and Set Builder

MHR-Damage is a website designed to help you optimize your damage output in Monster Hunter Rise by providing a variety of tools for building and customizing your armor sets. Here's how to use some of the main features:

**Automated Set Searcher** - This feature allows you to select the skills you want in your armor set and the website will automatically search for the best combination of armor pieces to achieve those skills. To use this feature, select the skills you want by using the dropdown menu in the bottom left corner of the page. Each skill starts at its maximum level by default, but you can adjust the level by clicking on either side of the skill name. Once you have selected your desired skills, click the "Find Build" button to the left of the skill select dropdown menu. This will generate a list of armor sets that meet your requirements.

**Extra Skills** - After you search for an armor set, the website will display a list of skills that could still be added to the set. This only shows the skills that the website found while testing the last set, so it is possible that there are other skills you could add or you could achieve a higher level than what is displayed. To update the list of builds and extra skills, you will need to search again.

Equip A Build: Before equipping a build If you want to change the charms used for the set, you can use the dropdown at the bottom of the Set Results build cards.  Once you have found an armor set you like, click the "Equip Build" button at the top of one of the equipment cards to update the armor display. 

Qurious Skills:  To expand the menus, click the buttons labeled "Qurious" on the armor displays.  This allows you to see what augments are used in your armor set and make adjustments if needed.

**Disclaimer** - The set-Builder will sometimes put more than 5 different skills on the same piece of armor.  These sets are not within the parameters of the game.  The majority of the time you just need to change the augments around and you can make it a legitimate set.

**Effective Damage** - If an attack hits more than one time per use the Effective Damage column will include every tic, while the others give the damage for only a single hit.  This column uses EFR and EFE for its output.

**Combo Creation** - This feature allows you to set your own combos to get a better idea of the overall impact a skill makes. To use this feature, click on the left or right side of an attack name to add or remove an attack from the combo. You can also directly change the number displayed by the attack name. The Combo Damage attack name itself acts as a repeat for the entire combo. There is a separate menu that will appear that also allows you to re-order the combo by dragging and dropping the skills.

**Shots To Kill** - This feature uses your effective damage to calculate the DPS uptime needed to kill the selected monster. Keep in mind that this assumes optimal timings for your recoil and reload, which can vary in actual gameplay. Unless you are doing a 4-player run where the monster will not be moving, we recommend that you take other factors into account like movement while reloading/shooting and support ammo available.

**Pierce Damage Adjust** - This feature adjusts the damage displayed in the Effective Damage column for Pierce Ammo and Elemental Pierce ammo to give you a more realistic damage output. The Legendary setting is unrealistic to achieve unless the monster has Water Blight.

**Spare Shot Adjust** - This feature allows you to add up to 10% to the selected Spare Shot activation rate.

**Scroll Swap** - To switch the active scroll, click on the red or blue scroll icons to toggle the selected color.

I still have a lot of ideas for expanding content yet to come!
