# MHR-Damage
Monster Hunter Rise Damage Calculations
A site designed to be capable of answering any optimization questions someone might have. Many unique features including

Automatically setting a build from a TA wiki set builder link.
While making a set on [MHR TA Wiki Set Builder](https://mhrise.wiki-db.com/sim/?hl=en) every time you hit search it encodes all your currently selected skills and skill levels into the url.  So after you make your set you can copy that url and paste it into the appropriate input to automatically set all relevant skills in the calculator.

Set your own combos to allow you to have a better idea on the overall impact a skill makes. 
This even removes sharpness when appropriate
To use this feature you can either click on the left or right side of an attack name to add or remove an attack from the combo or you can directly change the number displayed by the attack name. The Combo Damage attack name itself acts as a repeat for the entire combo.
After your enter in all moves used in the combo you can use the Combo Filter button to hide all other skills. 

Save selections to easily re load builds and combos
This feature will be improved soon but for now when you click the button it automatically saves an array of information to your clipboard.  When you paste this information into the TA Wiki set builder input it will re load any and all selections you had at the time. 

Bowguns will even give tell you how many shots it will take to kill a monster along with the dps uptime needed.

For the Quirios Augments just click on where it says quirios augments, then click on the right half of the name to increase and the left half to decrease. 

To switch the active scroll literally just click on the red or blue scroll.

I still have a lot of ideas for expanding content yet to come!
