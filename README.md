### Set Builder:

Select the skills you want by using the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the page. Each skill
starts at its maximum level by default, but you can adjust the level by clicking on either side of the 
skill name. When finished, click the "Find Build" button to the left of the skill select dropdown
menu.

### Skills List: 

After searching for a build, a list of skills that could still be added to the set will be displayed.  
This is not a definitive list so experiment a little. To update the list of builds and extra skills, you 
will need to search again. There is a dropdown on each build view or change the charm combinations.

### Augment Adjustments:

Clicking on any of the armor displays where it says "Qurious Remaining" will bring up the menus, so you
can see what augments are used in your armor set and make adjustments if needed.

### Effective Damage:

For attacks that hit more than once per use, the Effective Damage column will include every tick, while
the others give the damage for only a single hit. This column uses EFR and EFE for its output.

### Combo Creation: 

Set your own combos to get a better idea of the overall impact a build makes. You can click on the left
or right side of an attack name to add or remove an attack from the combo. You can also directly change
the number displayed by the attack name. The `Combo Damage` field acts as a combo repeat. There is a
separate menu that will appear that also allows you to reorder the combo by dragging and dropping the
skills.

### Shots To Kill:

This uses your effective damage to calculate the DPS uptime needed to kill the selected monster. As  
mentioned this is an DPS uptime to kill not a quest completion. I do still recommend you take other
things into consideration like if you can run-and-gun or the support ammo available. 

### Pierce Damage Adjust:

This selection adjusts the Effective Damage and Time to Kill for Pierce Ammo and Elemental Pierce ammo  
to show a more realistic damage output. I recommend the SpeedRun or Average, Legendary setting is 
unrealistic unless the monster has Water Blight.

### Spare Shot Adjust: 

Think you have better or worse than average RNG adjust this to account for the difference up to 10% to
the Spare Shot activation rate.

### Scroll Swap:

Just click on the red or blue scroll icons in the settings to toggle the selected color.
